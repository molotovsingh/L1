  "tier_b_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this taxonomy audit step by step. The user wants me to refine a list of cybersecurity event labels based on specific principles. Let me start by understanding each principle and how they apply to the candidate labels.\n\nFirst, the Event-Driven Focus principle. Each label must represent a discrete event, incident, change, or occurrence. So I need to check if any labels are too general or describe ongoing states. For example, \"Security-Patch-Release\" sounds like an event, but maybe \"Patch-Release\" is better? Wait, no, \"Security-Patch-Release\" is specific. But \"System-Outage\" might be a state rather than an event. Hmm, need to think about that.\n\nNext, Formatting: 1\u20134 words, TitleCase, hyphens. All the candidate labels seem to follow this except maybe \"Incident-Response-Activation\" which is four words. Wait, the user allows 1\u20134 words, so that's okay. But \"Incident-Response-Activation\" is a bit long. Maybe \"Incident-Response\" is sufficient? But the original is \"Incident-Response-Activation\" which is four words. Let me check the formatting rules again. The user says 1\u20134 words, so it's allowed. But maybe it's redundant. Let's hold that thought.\n\nDeny List: Reject labels with Hiring, Funding, Partnership. None of the candidate labels have those terms, so that's okay.\n\nConsolidation & Target Count: Merge synonyms or similar events. Aim for 8 labels (\u00b11). The original list has 14 labels. Need to reduce to 7-9. Let's see which can be merged.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n1. Data-Breach\n2. Malware-Infection\n3. DDoS-Attack\n4. Phishing-Attack\n5. Ransomware-Deployment\n6. Zero-Day-Exploit\n7. Security-Patch-Release\n8. Vulnerability-Disclosure\n9. Insider-Threat-Event\n10. System-Outage\n11. Regulatory-Action\n12. Cyber-Espionage\n13. Credential-Theft\n14. Incident-Response-Activation\n15. Supply-Chain-Compromise\n\nWait, the user listed 15 labels? Let me count again. The list provided has 15 items. Wait, the user's list starts with \"Data-Breach\" and ends with \"Supply-Chain-Compromise\". Let me recount:\n\n1. Data-Breach\n2. Malware-Infection\n3. DDoS-Attack\n4. Phishing-Attack\n5. Ransomware-Deployment\n6. Zero-Day-Exploit\n7. Security-Patch-Release\n8. Vulnerability-Disclosure\n9. Insider-Threat-Event\n10. System-Outage\n11. Regulatory-Action\n12. Cyber-Espionage\n13. Credential-Theft\n14. Incident-Response-Activation\n15. Supply-Chain-Compromise\n\nYes, 15 labels. Need to reduce to 7-9. So need to remove 6-8 labels.\n\nLet's start by identifying which labels are not events. For example, \"System-Outage\" is a state, not an event. So that should be rejected. \"Regulatory-Action\" is an event, but maybe too broad? Or is it a specific event like a regulatory action being taken? It depends. If it's a specific action, like a fine or a new regulation, then it's an event. But if it's a general theme, then it's not. The user's principle 1 says to reject general themes. So \"Regulatory-Action\" might be too broad. Maybe it's better to keep it if it's a specific event, but perhaps it's better to reject it as it's more of a category than an event.\n\n\"Security-Patch-Release\" is an event, but maybe it's a proactive measure rather than an incident. The taxonomy is for cybersecurity events, which might include both incidents and responses. But according to principle 1, it should be a discrete event. Releasing a patch is an event, so maybe it's acceptable. However, \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" is also an event. Are these two separate? Yes, because a patch release is a response to a vulnerability, while disclosure is the act of revealing the vulnerability. So both are valid.\n\n\"Insider-Threat-Event\" is an event, but maybe \"Insider-Threat\" is sufficient. However, the user's formatting allows hyphens, so \"Insider-Threat-Event\" is okay. But maybe it's redundant. Let's see.\n\n\"Credential-Theft\" is an event. \"Cyber-Espionage\" is a type of attack, which is an event. \"Supply-Chain-Compromise\" is an event.\n\nNow, looking for synonyms or similar events. For example, \"Phishing-Attack\" and \"Credential-Theft\" might be related but distinct. Phishing is a method to steal credentials, but the event is the attack, while credential theft is the result. So they are separate.\n\n\"Malware-Infection\" and \"Ransomware-Deployment\" are both types of malware attacks. Ransomware is a subset of malware, but as a specific type, it's better to keep both. However, if we need to consolidate, maybe merge them under \"Malware-Attack\", but the user's list has them as separate. But the user wants to merge synonyms. Are they synonyms? No, because ransomware is a specific type of malware. So they should remain separate.\n\n\"Zero-Day-Exploit\" is a specific type of exploit, so it's a valid event.\n\n\"DDoS-Attack\" is a specific attack type.\n\n\"Data-Breach\" is a result of an attack, but it's an event in itself.\n\n\"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" is an event where a vulnerability is disclosed.\n\n\"Security-Patch-Release\" is the release of a patch.\n\n\"Insider-Threat-Event\" is an event caused by an insider.\n\n\"System-Outage\" is a state, so reject.\n\n\"Regulatory-Action\" is a bit ambiguous. If it's a specific action like a fine or a new regulation, it's an event. But if it's a general category, it's not. The user's principle 1 says to reject general themes. So maybe reject \"Regulatory-Action\".\n\n\"Incident-Response-Activation\" is an event where the response is activated. That's a valid event.\n\n\"Supply-Chain-Compromise\" is an event where the supply chain is compromised.\n\nNow, let's see which labels can be merged or are redundant.\n\n\"Security-Patch-Release\" and \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" are both related to vulnerabilities but are separate events. So keep both.\n\n\"Insider-Threat-Event\" is a specific event type.\n\n\"System-Outage\" is a state, so reject.\n\n\"Regulatory-Action\" is too broad, reject.\n\n\"Incident-Response-Activation\" is a valid event.\n\nNow, the count is 15. Need to reduce to 7-9. Let's see which ones to remove.\n\nPossible candidates for removal:\n\n1. System-Outage (state, not event)\n2. Regulatory-Action (too broad)\n3. Security-Patch-Release (maybe proactive, not an incident)\n4. Vulnerability-Disclosure (maybe part of a process, not an event)\n5. Incident-Response-Activation (maybe part of the response, not the event itself)\n\nBut according to principle 1, the labels must represent events. So \"Security-Patch-Release\" is an event (releasing a patch), so it's valid. \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" is an event (disclosing a vulnerability). So they should stay.\n\n\"Incident-Response-Activation\" is an event where the response is activated. That's a valid event.\n\nSo removing \"System-Outage\" and \"Regulatory-Action\" brings us down to 13. Still need to remove more.\n\nLooking for other possible merges or rejections.\n\n\"Malware-Infection\" and \"Ransomware-Deployment\" are both malware-related. Could they be merged into \"Malware-Attack\"? But the user's list has them as separate. However, the principle says to merge synonyms. Are they synonyms? No, because ransomware is a specific type of malware. So they should remain separate.\n\n\"Phishing-Attack\" and \"Credential-Theft\" are related but distinct. Phishing is the attack method, credential theft is the result. So they are separate events.\n\n\"Zero-Day-Exploit\" is a specific exploit type.\n\n\"DDoS-Attack\" is a specific attack type.\n\n\"Data-Breach\" is a result of an attack.\n\n\"Insider-Threat-Event\" is a specific threat.\n\n\"Supply-Chain-Compromise\" is a specific compromise.\n\n\"Incident-Response-Activation\" is a response event.\n\n\"Security-Patch-Release\" and \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" are separate.\n\nSo maybe we need to remove some others. Let's see.\n\n\"Security-Patch-Release\" and \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" are both related to vulnerabilities but are separate events. Maybe keep both.\n\n\"Insider-Threat-Event\" is valid.\n\n\"Supply-Chain-Compromise\" is valid.\n\n\"Incident-Response-Activation\" is valid.\n\nSo perhaps remove \"Security-Patch-Release\" and \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" as they are more about vulnerability management than events. But according to the principles, they are events. So maybe keep them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Security-Patch-Release\" is a proactive event, not an incident. The",

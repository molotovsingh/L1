  "tier_b_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this taxonomy audit for cybersecurity events. The user wants me to refine the candidate labels based on specific principles. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the principles. The main ones are event-driven focus, formatting, deny list, and consolidation. The goal is to end up with around 9 labels, merging similar ones and rejecting those that don't fit.\n\nLooking at the candidate labels: Data-Breach, Malware-Outbreak, Ransomware-Attack, Denial-Of-Service, Insider-Threat, Zero-Day-Exploit, Regulatory-Action, Major-Discovery, System-Outage.\n\nStarting with the event-driven focus. Each label must be a discrete event. Let's check each one.\n\nData-Breach: Definitely an event. When data is breached, that's a specific incident. Approved.\n\nMalware-Outbreak: An outbreak is an event, like a sudden spread. Approved.\n\nRansomware-Attack: An attack is an event. Approved.\n\nDenial-Of-Service: A DoS attack is an event. Approved.\n\nInsider-Threat: Wait, \"threat\" is a bit vague. Is it an event or a general risk? The principle says to reject labels that describe general themes. An insider threat could be an ongoing risk, not a specific event. So maybe reject this. Need to check if it's an event. For example, an insider causing a breach would be a Data-Breach event. So Insider-Threat might be too broad. Rejected.\n\nZero-Day-Exploit: A zero-day exploit is a specific event where a vulnerability is exploited. Approved.\n\nRegulatory-Action: This could be an event, like a new regulation being enforced. Approved.\n\nMajor-Discovery: Discovery of something major, like a vulnerability. Approved.\n\nSystem-Outage: An outage is an event. Approved.\n\nNow formatting: All labels are in TitleCase with hyphens where needed. No leading symbols. Looks good.\n\nDeny list: Check for Hiring, Partnership, Funding. None of the labels have these terms. So no issues here.\n\nConsolidation: Are any labels too similar? Let's see. Ransomware-Attack is a type of Malware-Outbreak? Maybe, but ransomware is a specific type of malware. However, in the taxonomy, they might be considered separate events. The CISSM taxonomy in search result [1] differentiates between exploitive and disruptive events. Ransomware is a specific type of attack, so maybe it's better to keep it separate. Similarly, Denial-Of-Service is a specific attack type. So no consolidation needed here. All labels seem distinct.\n\nWait, but the user wants to aim for 9 \u00b11. The original list has 9 labels. If we reject Insider-Threat, that brings it down to 8. But the user allows 9 \u00b11, so 8 is acceptable. However, maybe there's another label to reject or consolidate.\n\nLooking again: Regulatory-Action and Major-Discovery. Are these events? Regulatory-Action could be an event like a new law being passed. Major-Discovery could be finding a vulnerability. Both are events. So they stay.\n\nSo the rejected label is Insider-Threat. The rest are approved. That gives 8 approved labels. The user allows 9 \u00b11, so 8 is okay.\n\nWait, but the example in the query had 3 approved and 3 rejected. Maybe the user expects more rejections. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original list has 9 labels. If we reject one, we have 8. The user says aim for 9 \u00b11, so 8 is within the range. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut maybe there's another label to reject. Let's see. Zero-Day-Exploit: Is that an event? Yes, when a zero-day is exploited. So it's okay.\n\nSo the final approved list would be 8 labels, and one rejected. But the user's example had 3 approved and 3 rejected. Maybe I need to check if any other labels can be merged or rejected.\n\nWait, the user's example had 3 approved and 3 rejected, but the original list here has 9. The user says to aim for 9 \u00b11, so 8-10. So 8 is acceptable.\n\nBut maybe I missed something. Let me check the principles again.\n\nPrinciple 1: Event-driven. Insider-Threat is not an event, so rejected. The rest are events.\n\nPrinciple 2: Formatting is okay.\n\nPrinciple 3: No denied terms.\n\nPrinciple 4: Consolidation. Are any labels synonyms? For example, Malware-Outbreak and Ransomware-Attack. Ransomware is a type of malware, but the outbreak refers to a spread, while ransomware attack is a specific attack. So they are different events. So no consolidation needed.\n\nSo the final list is 8 approved, 1 rejected. That's within the target count.\n\nBut the user's example had 3 approved and 3 rejected, but that's just an example. The actual count here is 8 approved, 1 rejected. That's acceptable as per the user's instruction.\n\nSo the approved labels are all except Insider-Threat. The rejected label is Insider-Threat, with the reason that it's not event-driven but describes a general risk.\n\nWait, but in the search results, the CISSM taxonomy in [1] differentiates between exploitive and disruptive events. Insider-Threat might fall under exploitive if it's an insider causing a breach, but the label itself is too broad. So it's better to reject it.\n\nAnother point: The JRC Cybersecurity Taxonomy in [3] mentions categorizing events, but doesn't specify labels. The NCISS in [5] has levels but not event types. The Bitsight taxonomy in [2] has classes like internal network risks, employee-generated risks, etc., but those are risk vectors, not events. So the user's labels are more about events, not risk vectors.\n\nSo the conclusion is to reject Insider-Threat and keep the rest. That gives 8 approved labels, which is within the target count.\n</think>\n\nAPPROVED LABELS:  \nData-Breach  \nMalware-Outbreak  \nRansomware-Attack  \nDenial-Of-Service  \nZero-Day-Exploit  \nRegulatory-Action  \nMajor-Discovery  \nSystem-Outage  \n\nREJECTED LABELS:  \nInsider-Threat  \n\nREJECTION REASONS:  \nInsider-Threat: Fails the **event-driven focus** principle. \"Threat\" describes a general risk category rather than a discrete incident. Insider activities that result in breaches would fall under \"Data-Breach\" or other specific event types[1][2].  \n\n---\n\n**Rationale for Approved Labels**  \n1. **Event-Driven Focus**: All approved labels represent discrete incidents (e.g., breaches, attacks, outages) rather than ongoing states or capabilities[1][5].  \n2. **Formatting Compliance**: Labels adhere to TitleCase with hyphens only between words (e.g., \"Data-Breach\" vs. \"AI-Powered\")[2].  \n3. **Deny List Compliance**: No labels contain \"Hiring,\" \"Partnership,\" or \"Funding\"[2].  \n4. **Consolidation**: No redundant labels exist. For example, \"Ransomware-Attack\" and \"Malware-Outbreak\" are distinct: the former specifies a targeted attack type, while the latter denotes a broader spread of malicious software[1][5].  \n\n**Taxonomy Alignment**  \nThe approved labels align with established frameworks like the CISSM taxonomy, which categorizes events by impact (e.g., exploitive vs. disruptive)[1], and the NCISS system, which evaluates incident severity based on network penetration levels[5].",

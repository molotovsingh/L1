  "tier_b_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this taxonomy audit step by step. The user wants me to refine the candidate labels for cybersecurity events based on specific principles. Let me start by understanding each principle and how they apply to the given labels.\n\nFirst, the Event-Driven Focus principle. Each label must represent a discrete event, incident, change, or occurrence. So I need to check if each candidate label is an actual event or something more general. For example, \"Software-Launch\" is an event, but \"Cloud Infrastructure\" would be a general theme, which is not allowed. Looking at the list, \"Software-Launch\" seems okay, but maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is too broad? Wait, no, a cyber attack is a specific event. Hmm.\n\nNext, Formatting. Labels should be 1\u20134 words, TitleCase, hyphens only between words. Let's check each label. \"Data-Breach\" is good. \"System-Outage\" is okay. \"Major-Discovery\" \u2013 is \"Major\" necessary? Maybe \"Discovery\" is sufficient, but the user included \"Major\" so maybe it's intended. \"Regulatory-Action\" is fine. \"Software-Launch\" is okay. \"Cyber-Attack\" is good. \"Vulnerability-Exposure\" \u2013 maybe \"Vulnerability-Exposure\" is a bit long, but it's within the word limit. \"Network-Intrusion\" is okay. \"Security-Patch-Release\" \u2013 that's four words, which is allowed. \"Incident-Response\" \u2013 that's an event, but wait, incident response is a process, not an event. So maybe that's a problem. \"Malware-Outbreak\" is okay. \"Encryption-Breakthrough\" \u2013 that's an event, like a new method to break encryption. \"Compliance-Failure\" is okay.\n\nDeny List: Reject any label with Funding, Hiring, Partnership. None of the candidates have those terms, so that's okay.\n\nConsolidation & Target Count: Merge synonyms or similar types. The user wants around 15 labels. Let's see. The original list has 13 labels. Maybe some can be merged. For example, \"Network-Intrusion\" and \"Cyber-Attack\" might overlap. But \"Cyber-Attack\" is broader, while \"Network-Intrusion\" is a specific type. Maybe keep both. \"Security-Patch-Release\" is specific. \"Incident-Response\" \u2013 as mentioned earlier, this is a process, not an event. So maybe reject that. \"Encryption-Breakthrough\" is a specific event, like a new method discovered. \"Compliance-Failure\" is an event. \"Major-Discovery\" \u2013 maybe \"Discovery\" is enough, but \"Major\" adds context. Let's keep it as is.\n\nNow, applying the principles:\n\n1. Event-Driven Focus: Check each label. \"Incident-Response\" is a process, not an event. So reject that. \"Software-Launch\" is an event. \"Major-Discovery\" is an event. \"Regulatory-Action\" is an event. \"Cyber-Attack\" is an event. \"Vulnerability-Exposure\" is an event. \"Network-Intrusion\" is an event. \"Security-Patch-Release\" is an event. \"Malware-Outbreak\" is an event. \"Encryption-Breakthrough\" is an event. \"Compliance-Failure\" is an event. \"Data-Breach\" is an event. \"System-Outage\" is an event. So \"Incident-Response\" is the only one that's a process, so reject that.\n\n2. Formatting: All labels are in TitleCase, hyphens between words, no leading symbols. \"Security-Patch-Release\" has three words, which is allowed. So no issues here.\n\n3. Deny List: No terms in the deny list, so all are okay.\n\n4. Consolidation: The original list has 13 labels. The user wants 15 \u00b11. So maybe we can keep all except \"Incident-Response\", which brings it to 12. But the user wants around 15. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me recount. The original list has 13 labels. If we reject \"Incident-Response\", that's 12. But the user wants 15 \u00b11. Hmm, maybe I need to check if any other labels can be merged or if some are redundant. For example, \"Cyber-Attack\" and \"Network-Intrusion\" \u2013 maybe \"Network-Intrusion\" is a type of cyber attack, but they are distinct. \"Vulnerability-Exposure\" is a specific event. \"Encryption-Breakthrough\" is unique. \"Compliance-Failure\" is separate. \"Data-Breach\" is a specific type. \"System-Outage\" is another. \"Major-Discovery\" could be merged with something else? Maybe not. \"Regulatory-Action\" is distinct. \"Software-Launch\" is okay. \"Security-Patch-Release\" is specific. \"Malware-Outbreak\" is okay. So maybe the user's original list is 13, and after rejecting \"Incident-Response\", it's 12. But the target is 15 \u00b11. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the original list again:\n\nThe candidate labels are:\n\n1. Data-Breach\n2. System-Outage\n3. Major-Discovery\n4. Regulatory-Action\n5. Software-Launch\n6. Cyber-Attack\n7. Vulnerability-Exposure\n8. Network-Intrusion\n9. Security-Patch-Release\n10. Incident-Response\n11. Malware-Outbreak\n12. Encryption-Breakthrough\n13. Compliance-Failure\n\nThat's 13 labels. If we reject \"Incident-Response\", we have 12. The user wants 15 \u00b11, so maybe we need to add more. But the user provided 13, and we can't add new ones. Wait, the task is to refine the given list, not to add new labels. So perhaps the user's original list is 13, and after rejecting \"Incident-Response\", it's 12. But the target is 15 \u00b11. Hmm, maybe the user expects us to merge some labels to reach 15. Wait, no, the user says to merge clear synonyms or overly similar types. So maybe some labels can be merged. Let's see:\n\n- \"Cyber-Attack\" and \"Network-Intrusion\": Maybe \"Network-Intrusion\" is a subset of \"Cyber-Attack\", but they are distinct. So keep both.\n\n- \"Vulnerability-Exposure\" and \"Data-Breach\": Not directly related. \"Vulnerability-Exposure\" is about revealing a vulnerability, while \"Data-Breach\" is about data being stolen.\n\n- \"Security-Patch-Release\" is unique.\n\n- \"Encryption-Breakthrough\" is unique.\n\n- \"Compliance-Failure\" is unique.\n\n- \"Malware-Outbreak\" is unique.\n\n- \"Software-Launch\" is unique.\n\n- \"Regulatory-Action\" is unique.\n\n- \"Major-Discovery\" is unique.\n\n- \"System-Outage\" is unique.\n\nSo maybe no merging is possible. Then the final count would be 12. But the user wants 15 \u00b11. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The user says \"Aim for a final list of 15 (\u00b11) distinct, high-value event categories.\" But the original list has 13, and after rejecting one, it's 12. That's below 15. But the user can't add new labels, so perhaps the answer is to keep all except \"Incident-Response\", resulting in 12, but the user allows \u00b11, so 12 is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe some labels can be split or rephrased. But the task is to refine the given list, not to create new ones. So perhaps the answer is to reject \"Incident-Response\" and keep the rest, resulting in 12 labels. But the user's example had 3 approved and 3 rejected, but the target is 15. Hmm, maybe the user's example is just an example, and the actual answer should follow the principles strictly. So in this case, the only label to reject is \"Incident-Response\". The rest are okay. So the approved list would have 12 labels, which is within 15 \u00b11 (14-16). Wait, 12 is below 14. So maybe the user expects more labels. But the original list has 13, and after rejecting one, it's 12. Maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the instructions, we have to work with the given labels. So perhaps the answer is to reject \"Incident-Response\" and keep the rest, resulting in 12 labels. But the user's target is 15 \u00b11. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the user's example is not to scale. Alternatively, maybe some labels can be merged. Let's see:\n\n- \"Cyber-Attack\" and \"Network-Intrusion\": Maybe \"Network-Intrusion\" is a type of cyber attack, but they are distinct. So keep both.\n\n- \"Vulnerability-Exposure\" and \"Data-Breach\": Not directly related.\n\n- \"Security-Patch-Release\" is unique.\n\n- \"Encryption-Breakthrough\" is unique.\n\n- \"Compliance-Failure\" is unique.\n\n- \"Malware-Outbreak\" is unique.\n\n- \"Software-Launch\" is unique.\n\n- \"Regulatory-Action\" is unique.\n\n- \"Major-Discovery\" is unique.\n\n- \"System-Outage\" is unique.\n\n- \"Data-Breach\" is unique.\n\nSo no merging possible.

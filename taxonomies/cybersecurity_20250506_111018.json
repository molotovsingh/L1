  "tier_a_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a list of top-level categories for cybersecurity events. They need to be specific types of events, not ongoing states. Let me start by brainstorming possible events in cybersecurity.\n\nFirst, data breaches are obvious. That's a clear event. Then maybe malware attacks, like ransomware incidents. Vulnerabilities being discovered, especially critical ones. Phishing campaigns are specific events too. Regulatory actions, like fines or new regulations being imposed. System outages caused by cyberattacks. Zero-day exploits being disclosed. Threat actor campaigns, like coordinated attacks by a specific group. Supply chain compromises, where third-party software is compromised. Critical infrastructure attacks, targeting things like power grids. Identity theft incidents. DDoS attacks disrupting services. Insider threats leading to data leaks. Cryptographic failures exposing data. Cyber espionage cases. \n\nWait, the user said 8-15 categories. Let me check if these are all events. Regulatory actions, data breaches, malware outbreaks, vulnerability disclosures, phishing campaigns, system outages, zero-day exploits, threat actor campaigns, supply chain compromises, critical infrastructure attacks. That's 10. Maybe add DDoS attacks and insider threat incidents. Cryptographic failures? That's a type of event when a flaw is found. Cyber espionage incidents. Hmm, maybe some of these can be combined or adjusted.\n\nNeed to make sure they're specific and event-driven. Avoid generic terms. The examples given were like Data-Breach, Regulatory-Approval. So maybe \"Regulatory-Action\" instead of \"Regulatory-Approval\". Also, check for hyphenated terms. Let me structure them properly. \n\nWait, the example had \"Model-Launch\", \"System-Outage\", \"Major-Discovery\". So each label is a noun phrase in TitleCase with hyphens if needed. Let me format each accordingly. \n\nData-Breach, Malware-Outbreak, Vulnerability-Disclosure, Phishing-Campaign, Regulatory-Action, System-Outage, Zero-Day-Exploit, Threat-Actor-Campaign, Supply-Chain-Compromise, Critical-Infrastructure-Attack, DDoS-Attack, Insider-Threat-Incident, Cryptographic-Failure, Cyber-Espionage-Case. That's 14. Maybe some can be merged. For example, Cyber-Espionage-Case might be too specific. Maybe just Cyber-Espionage. But the user wants events. Maybe \"Cyber-Espionage-Disclosure\" or \"State-Sponsored-Attack\". Hmm. Alternatively, \"Advanced-Persistent-Threat\" but that's a type, not an event. \n\nWait, the user said \"specific types of events or discrete occurrences\". So maybe \"Advanced-Persistent-Threat-Campaign\" is an event. But that's getting too long. Let me stick to the initial list. Check for duplicates or overlaps. For example, Threat-Actor-Campaign and Advanced-Persistent-Threat might overlap. Maybe better to use Threat-Actor-Campaign as a broader category. \n\nAlso, check if all terms are events. Vulnerability-Disclosure is an event when a vulnerability is made public. Regulatory-Action is when a regulation is enforced or a fine is issued. System-Outage due to an attack. Zero-Day-Exploit refers to the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability. \n\nI think the list is okay. Let me count again. 14 items. The user asked for 8-15, so that's within range. Now, ensure no hyphens are overused. Each label should be 1-4 words. Let me check each:\n\nData-Breach (2 words), Malware-Outbreak (2), Vulnerability-Disclosure (2), Phishing-Campaign (2), Regulatory-Action (2), System-Outage (2), Zero-Day-Exploit (3), Threat-Actor-Campaign (3), Supply-Chain-Compromise (3), Critical-Infrastructure-Attack (3), DDoS-Attack (2), Insider-Threat-Incident (3), Cryptographic-Failure (2), Cyber-Espionage-Case (3). All within 1-4 words. Hyphens are used correctly. No hash symbols. Titles are capitalized. \n\nExcluded generic terms like Funding, Partnership. Each is an event. Looks good. Now, output as JSON array.\n</think>\n\n[\"Data-Breach\", \"Malware-Outbreak\", \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\", \"Phishing-Campaign\", \"Regulatory-Action\", \"System-Outage\", \"Zero-Day-Exploit\", \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\", \"Supply-Chain-Compromise\", \"Critical-Infrastructure-Attack\", \"DDoS-Attack\", \"Insider-Threat-Incident\", \"Cryptographic-Failure\", \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\"]",
  "tier_b_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by reviewing each candidate label against the given principles. \n\nFirst, the Event-Driven Focus principle. I need to ensure each label represents a discrete event. Let's go through each one:\n\n- \"Data-Breach\": Yes, this is a specific incident. Approved.\n- \"Malware-Outbreak\": An outbreak is an event. Approved.\n- \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\": Disclosure is an event. Approved.\n- \"Phishing-Campaign\": A campaign is a series of events, but it's still an incident. Approved.\n- \"Regulatory-Action\": An action like a fine or regulation is an event. Approved.\n- \"System-Outage\": Outage is an event. Approved.\n- \"Zero-Day-Exploit\": The exploit itself is an event. Approved.\n- \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\": Similar to phishing campaign, it's an incident. Approved.\n- \"Supply-Chain-Compromise\": A compromise is an event. Approved.\n- \"Critical-Infrastructure-Attack\": An attack is an event. Approved.\n- \"DDoS-Attack\": Specific type of attack. Approved.\n- \"Insider-Threat-Incident\": Incident is an event. Approved.\n- \"Cryptographic-Failure\": A failure is an event. Approved.\n- \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\": A case implies a specific incident. Approved.\n\nNext, check formatting. All labels are in TitleCase with hyphens where needed. No issues here.\n\nDeny List: None of the labels contain \"Funding\", \"Hiring\", or \"Partnership\". So no rejections here.\n\nConsolidation & Target Count: The initial list has 14 labels. The target is 15\u00b11, so 14 is acceptable. Check for synonyms. Let's see:\n\n- \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\" and \"Phishing-Campaign\" both involve campaigns but are different in nature. Maybe keep both.\n- \"Zero-Day-Exploit\" and \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" are related but distinct. Zero-day is a type of vulnerability, but disclosure is the act of revealing it. They can stay separate.\n- \"Critical-Infrastructure-Attack\" and \"DDoS-Attack\" are specific types of attacks. Both are valid.\n- \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\" and \"Data-Breach\" might overlap, but espionage is more specific. Keep both.\n\nNo obvious synonyms to merge. All labels seem distinct and high-value for cybersecurity. So all 14 are approved. Wait, the original list has 14, and the example output had 3 approved. But the user's candidate list has 14, and the target is 15\u00b11. Since 14 is within the range, no need to merge. So all 14 are approved. But wait, the user's example output had 3 approved, but the task says aim for 15\u00b11. Wait, the candidate list provided has 14 labels. The user's task says to aim for 15\u00b11, so 13-16. The current list is 14, which is within range. So no need to merge. Therefore, all 14 are approved. But wait, the user's example output had \"rejected\" entries. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the candidate list has 14 labels. The user's example output had 3 approved and 3 rejected. But according to the principles, we need to aim for 15\u00b11. But the candidate list is 14. So maybe some labels need to be merged. Let me check again for possible overlaps.\n\nLooking at \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\" and \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\". A threat actor campaign could involve espionage, but they might be distinct. Similarly, \"Malware-Outbreak\" and \"DDoS-Attack\" are different. Maybe \"Insider-Threat-Incident\" and \"Cryptographic-Failure\" are distinct. I don't see clear synonyms. So perhaps all 14 are acceptable. But the user's target is 15\u00b11, so 14 is within range. Therefore, all are approved. But wait, the initial count is 14, and the target is 15\u00b11. So 14 is acceptable. Therefore, no need to reject any unless they violate other principles.\n\nWait, but the example output had some rejected. Let me check each label again for compliance.\n\n\"Cyber-Espionage-Case\": The term \"Case\" might be considered a general theme? No, a case is a specific incident. So it's event-driven. Approved.\n\nAll others seem to be events. So the approved list would include all 14. But the user's example output had some rejected. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the deny list again. None of the labels have the denied terms. Formatting is correct. So all 14 are approved. But the user's task says to aim for 15\u00b11. Since 14 is within that range, it's acceptable. Therefore, the answer would have all 14 approved, and no rejected. But the user's example had some rejected. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the candidate list has 14 labels. The user's task says to aim for 15\u00b11, which is 14-16. So 14 is acceptable. Therefore, all labels can be approved if they meet the criteria. But let me check each label again.\n\nWait, \"Cryptographic-Failure\": Is that an event? A failure is an event. For example, a failure leading to a security breach. So yes. Approved.\n\n\"Regulatory-Action\": An action like a new regulation or a fine is an event. Approved.\n\nAll others seem to fit. Therefore, the approved list includes all 14, and no rejections. But the user's example had some rejected. However, according to the principles, if all labels are valid, then they should all be approved. So perhaps the answer is to approve all 14. But the user's example output had some rejected. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's example output had \"ProductUpdate\" merged into \"Major-Release\". But in our case, are there any labels that are synonyms? For example, \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\" and \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\" might be overlapping, but they are different. A threat actor campaign could be espionage, but not necessarily. Similarly, \"Malware-Outbreak\" and \"Zero-Day-Exploit\" are different. So no synonyms to merge. Therefore, all 14 are approved. But the user's task says to aim for 15\u00b11, which is 14-16. So 14 is acceptable. Therefore, the answer is to approve all 14, with no rejections. But the user's example had some rejected. Maybe the user expects some to be rejected. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Cryptographic-Failure\" is a general state rather than an event. For example, a failure could be an ongoing issue. But in the context of cybersecurity, a cryptographic failure leading to a breach would be an event. So it's acceptable. Similarly, \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\" is an event when the vulnerability is disclosed. So approved.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is to approve all 14 labels. But the initial count was 14, and the target is 15\u00b11, so it's within range. Therefore, the JSON would have all 14 approved, and rejected as empty. But the user's example had some rejected. However, according to the principles, if all labels are valid, they should be approved. So perhaps the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"approved\": [\"Data-Breach\", \"Malware-Outbreak\", \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\", \"Phishing-Campaign\", \"Regulatory-Action\", \"System-Outage\", \"Zero-Day-Exploit\", \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\", \"Supply-Chain-Compromise\", \"Critical-Infrastructure-Attack\", \"DDoS-Attack\", \"Insider-Threat-Incident\", \"Cryptographic-Failure\", \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\"],\n  \"rejected\": [],\n  \"reason_rejected\": {}\n}\n\nBut the user's example had some rejected. However, according to the principles, if all labels are valid, this is correct. But maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\" and \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\" could be considered similar. For example, a cyber-espionage case might be part of a threat actor campaign. But they are distinct enough. Similarly, \"Phishing-Campaign\" is a specific type of campaign. So they are separate. Therefore, no merging needed. So the answer is as above.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"approved\": [\n    \"Data-Breach\",\n    \"Malware-Outbreak\",\n    \"Vulnerability-Disclosure\",\n    \"Phishing-Campaign\",\n    \"Regulatory-Action\",\n    \"System-Outage\",\n    \"Zero-Day-Exploit\",\n    \"Threat-Actor-Campaign\",\n    \"Supply-Chain-Compromise\",\n    \"Critical-Infrastructure-Attack\",\n    \"DDoS-Attack\",\n    \"Insider-Threat-Incident\",\n    \"Cryptographic-Failure\",\n    \"Cyber-Espionage-Case\"\n  ],\n  \"rejected\": [],\n  \"reason_rejected\": {}\n}",

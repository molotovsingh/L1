  "tier_b_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this taxonomy audit step by step. The user wants me to review the candidate labels for the cybersecurity domain based on specific principles. First, I need to understand each principle clearly.\n\nPrinciple 1: Event-Driven Focus. Each label must be a discrete event, incident, change, or occurrence. So I need to reject anything that's a general theme, capability, technology, or ongoing state. For example, \"Security-Tool-Launch\" is okay because it's a specific event, but \"Security-Tool\" alone would be a technology, not an event.\n\nPrinciple 2: Formatting. Labels should be 1\u20134 words, TitleCase, with hyphens only between words. No leading symbols. So \"Data-Breach\" is good, but \"AI-Powered\" might be questionable unless it's part of a specific event like \"AI-Powered-Tool-Launch\".\n\nPrinciple 3: Deny List. Reject any label with \"Partnership\", \"Hiring\", or \"Funding\". So I need to check each label for these exact terms. None of the candidate labels have these, so maybe this principle isn't triggered here, but I should still verify.\n\nPrinciple 4: Consolidation & Target Count. Merge synonyms or similar events. Aim for 20\u00b11 labels. The original list has 20 labels, so maybe some can be merged. Let's see.\n\nNow, let's go through each candidate label:\n\n1. Data-Breach: This is a clear event. Approved.\n2. Ransomware-Attack: Specific attack type. Approved.\n3. Phishing-Campaign: An event where phishing attempts are made. Approved.\n4. Malware-Discovery: Discovering malware is an event. Approved.\n5. Zero-Day-Exploit: Using a zero-day vulnerability is an event. Approved.\n6. System-Outage: A system going down. Approved.\n7. Insider-Threat: An incident caused by an insider. Approved.\n8. DDoS-Attack: A specific attack type. Approved.\n9. Security-Patch-Release: Releasing a patch is an event. Approved.\n10. Vulnerability-Disclosure: Disclosing a vulnerability. Approved.\n11. Regulatory-Action: Action taken by regulators. Approved.\n12. Cybersecurity-Breach-Notification: Notifying a breach. Approved.\n13. Supply-Chain-Attack: Attack via supply chain. Approved.\n14. Credential-Theft: Stealing credentials. Approved.\n15. Incident-Response-Activation: Activating response. Approved.\n16. Security-Tool-Launch: Launching a tool. Approved.\n17. Cybersecurity-Policy-Update: Updating a policy. Approved.\n18. Threat-Intelligence-Report: Releasing a report. Approved.\n19. Critical-Infrastructure-Attack: Attack on critical infrastructure. Approved.\n\nWait, that's 19 labels. The original list has 20. Let me check again. The user's list has 20 labels. Let me recount:\n\n1. Data-Breach\n2. Ransomware-Attack\n3. Phishing-Campaign\n4.

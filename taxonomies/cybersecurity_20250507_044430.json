  "tier_b_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a meticulous taxonomy auditor for cybersecurity event labels. The task is to review the given candidate labels based on specific principles and return a refined list. Let's break down the principles and apply them one by one.\n\nFirst, the principles to enforce are:\n\n1. **Event-Driven Focus**: Each label must represent a discrete event, incident, change, or occurrence. Reject labels that describe general themes, capabilities, technologies, or ongoing states. For example, \"Machine Learning\" or \"Cloud Infrastructure\" would be rejected because they're not specific events.\n\n2. **Formatting**: Labels should be 1\u20134 words, TitleCase. Hyphens are allowed only between words. No leading symbols like '#'. So, \"Data-Breach\" is okay, but \"AI-Powered\" might be questionable unless it's a specific event like a launch.\n\n3. **Deny List**: Reject any label containing the exact terms: Partnership, Hiring, Funding. So, if any label has these words, they're out.\n\n4. **Consolidation & Target Count**: Merge clear synonyms or overly similar event types. Aim for a final list of 20 (\u00b11) distinct, high-value categories. Prioritize the most significant and common event types.\n\nNow, looking at the candidate labels provided:\n\n[\n  \"[\",\n  \"\\\"Data-Breach\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Ransomware-Attack\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Malware-Outbreak\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Denial-Of-Service\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Insider-Threat\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Zero-Day-Exploit\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Regulatory-Action\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Major-Discovery\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"System-Outage\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Web-Application-Attack\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"IoT-Breach\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Cryptographic-Vulnerability\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Advanced-Persistent-Threat\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Man-In-The-Middle-Attack\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Business-Email-Compromise\\\",\",\n  \"\\\"Supply-Chain-Attack\\\"\",\n  \"]\"\n]\n\nFirst, I need to check each label against the principles.\n\nStarting with **Event-Driven Focus**. Let's go through each label:\n\n- **Data-Breach**: This is a specific event where data is compromised. Good.\n- **Ransomware-Attack**: A specific type of attack. Good.\n- **Malware-Outbreak**: An outbreak is an event. Good.\n- **Denial-Of-Service**: A DoS attack is an event. Good.\n- **Insider-Threat**: This is a bit tricky. \"Threat\" is more of a general term. An insider threat could be an ongoing issue, not a discrete event. Maybe this should be rejected. Wait, but \"Insider-Threat\" as an event? Maybe it's considered an incident when it occurs. Hmm. Need to check the search results for guidance.\n\nLooking at the search results, especially [2], which discusses a taxonomy for cyber events. The CISSM taxonomy classifies events into Exploitive and Disruptive types. Insider threats might fall under Exploitive if they involve data theft. But the label \"Insider-Threat\" is more about the source than the event itself. Maybe it's better to have \"Insider-Incident\" or \"Insider-Attack\" instead. But the given label is \"Insider-Threat\". Since \"Threat\" is a general term, this might not be event-driven. So, reject.\n\n- **Zero-Day-Exploit**: A zero-day exploit is a specific event where a vulnerability is exploited. Good.\n- **Regulatory-Action**: This is an event, like a new regulation being enforced. Good.\n- **Major-Discovery**: Discovery of something significant, like a vulnerability. Good.\n- **System-Outage**: A system going down is an event. Good.\n- **Web-Application-Attack**: Specific attack type. Good.\n- **IoT-Breach**: Breach of IoT devices. Good.\n- **Cryptographic-Vulnerability**: This is a vulnerability, not an event. A vulnerability is a state, not an event. So, reject.\n- **Advanced-Persistent-Threat**: APT is a type of threat actor, not an event. The event would be an attack by an APT group. So, \"Advanced-Persistent-Threat-Attack\" would be better, but the label here is just \"Advanced-Persistent-Threat\", which is a threat type, not an event. Reject.\n- **Man-In-The-Middle-Attack**: Specific attack type. Good.\n- **Business-Email-Compromise**: BEC is a specific attack type. Good.\n- **Supply-Chain-Attack**: Attack targeting supply chains. Good.\n\nNext, **Formatting**. All labels seem to be in TitleCase with hyphens between words. No leading symbols. So formatting is okay.\n\n**Deny List**: None of the labels contain Partnership, Hiring, or Funding. So no issues here.\n\n**Consolidation**: Are there any synonyms or similar labels that can be merged? Let's see:\n\n- **Malware-Outbreak** vs. **Ransomware-Attack**: These are different. Malware outbreak is a broader term, ransomware is a specific type. Keep both.\n- **Denial-Of-Service** is a specific attack type. No duplicates.\n- **Zero-Day-Exploit** is unique.\n- **Cryptographic-Vulnerability** is a vulnerability, not an event. Rejected.\n- **Advanced-Persistent-Threat** is a threat type, not an event. Rejected.\n- **Insider-Threat** is a threat, not an event. Rejected.\n\nSo, after applying the principles, the rejected labels would be:\n\n- **Insider-Threat**: Not event-driven, describes a threat source.\n- **Cryptographic-Vulnerability**: Describes a vulnerability, not an event.\n- **Advanced-Persistent-Threat**: Describes a threat type, not an event.\n\nNow, check the count. Original list has 16 labels. After rejecting 3, we have 13. The target is 20 \u00b11, so we need to add more. Wait, but the user provided 16 labels. Wait, the candidate list has 16 labels (excluding the brackets and quotes). Let me recount:\n\nThe list inside the brackets is:\n\n1. Data-Breach\n2. Ransomware-Attack\n3. Malware-Outbreak\n4. Denial-Of-Service\n5. Insider-Threat\n6. Zero-Day-Exploit\n7. Regulatory-Action\n8. Major-Discovery\n9. System-Outage\n10. Web-Application-Attack\n11. IoT-Breach\n12. Cryptographic-Vulnerability\n13. Advanced-Persistent-Threat\n14. Man-In-The-Middle-Attack\n15. Business-Email-Compromise\n16. Supply-Chain-Attack\n\nSo 16 labels. After rejecting 3, we have 13. The target is 20 \u00b11, so we need to add 7 more. But the user hasn't provided additional labels. Wait, the task is to refine the given list, not to add new ones. So maybe the user expects us to merge some labels or perhaps the initial list is to be pruned, but the target count is 20 \u00b11. However, the given list has 16, and after rejecting 3, we have 13. That's below 20. But the user says \"Aim for a final list of 20 (\u00b11) distinct, high-value event categories.\" But the candidate list only has 16. So perhaps the user expects us to merge some labels to reduce the count, but the target is 20. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the user made a mistake in the target count, or perhaps the initial list is to be pruned to 20. But the initial list is 16. Hmm. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Aim for a final list of 20 (\u00b11) distinct, high-value event categories.\" But the candidate list has 16. So perhaps the user expects us to add more, but the task is to refine the given list. Maybe the user intended to have the auditor add more labels, but the instructions say to return a refined list from the given candidates. So perhaps the target count is a typo, or maybe the user expects the auditor to merge some labels to reach 20. But with 16 candidates, after rejecting 3, we have 13. That's way below 20. This is confusing. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the target count. Alternatively, perhaps the auditor is supposed to merge some labels to reduce the count, but the target is 20. That doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe the target count is a maximum, and the auditor should aim for around 20, but the given list is shorter. This is unclear. But given the instructions, the auditor must work with the provided labels. So perhaps the target count is a guideline, but the actual list may be shorter. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the auditor to add more labels, but the task is to refine the given ones. Since the task is to return a refined list from the given candidates, the auditor can't add new labels. Therefore, the target count of 20 \u00b11 might be a mistake, or perhaps the user intended to have the auditor merge some labels to reach that count. But with 16 candidates, after rejecting 3, we have 13. That's not close to 20. This suggests that perhaps the target count is not strictly enforced, or maybe the user expects the auditor to prioritize the most significant events, even if the count is lower. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the auditor merge some labels to reduce the count, but the target is 20.",

  "tier_b_raw_output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this taxonomy audit step by step. The user wants me to review the candidate labels for the cybersecurity domain based on specific principles. Let's start by understanding each principle and how they apply to the given labels.\n\nFirst, the Event-Driven Focus principle. Each label must represent a discrete event, incident, change, or occurrence. So I need to check if each label is an actual event or something more general. For example, \"Data-Breach\" is an event, but something like \"Cloud Infrastructure\" would be a general theme and should be rejected. Looking at the candidate list, \"Cyber-Attack\" is a bit broad. Wait, but in the search results, the CISSM taxonomy differentiates between Exploitive and Disruptive events. Maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is too vague. However, the user's example includes \"Cyber-Attack\" as approved, so perhaps it's acceptable if it's a specific event type. Hmm, need to be careful here.\n\nNext, Formatting. Labels should be 1\u20134 words, TitleCase, hyphens only between words. Let's check each label. \"Data-Breach\" is okay. \"System-Outage\" is good. \"Malware-Outbreak\" \u2013 \"Outbreak\" might be a bit long, but it's within the word limit. \"DDoS-Attack\" is fine. \"Regulatory-Action\" \u2013 \"Action\" is a bit vague, but maybe acceptable. \"Major-Discovery\" \u2013 \"Discovery\" is an event. \"Software-Vulnerability\" \u2013 \"Vulnerability\" is a state, not an event. Wait, that's a problem. \"Security-Patch-Release\" is an event. \"Cryptographic-Breakthrough\" \u2013 \"Breakthrough\" is an event. \"Ransomware-Incident\" \u2013 \"Incident\" is okay. \"Cloud-Service-Disruption\" \u2013 \"Disruption\" is an event.\n\nDeny List: Reject any label with Funding, Hiring, Partnership. None of the candidate labels have these terms, so that's okay.\n\nConsolidation & Target Count: Merge synonyms or similar types. The user wants around 15 labels. Let's see. The original list has 13 labels. Maybe some can be merged. For example, \"Cyber-Attack\" is a broad category. The search results mention differentiating between Exploitive and Disruptive events. Maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is too broad and should be split into more specific types. But the user's example includes \"Cyber-Attack\" as approved, so perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" can be merged with others. Wait, looking at the candidate list, \"Cyber-Attack\" is separate from \"DDoS-Attack\" and \"Ransomware-Incident\". Those are specific types of attacks, so maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is too general. But according to the principles, if it's a discrete event, it's okay. However, the CISSM taxonomy in search result [2] categorizes events into Exploitive and Disruptive, with subcategories. So perhaps \"Cyber-Attack\" is too vague and should be replaced with more specific terms. But the user's example includes it, so maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is a valid label as a general category, but the more specific ones like DDoS and Ransomware are separate. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nLooking at the labels, \"Cyber-Attack\" is a general term, while others are specific. The principle says to reject general themes, but \"Cyber-Attack\" is an event. However, in the CISSM taxonomy, they have more specific subcategories. Maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is too broad and should be split into more specific events. But the user's example includes it, so perhaps it's allowed. Alternatively, maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is redundant with other specific attack types. For example, \"DDoS-Attack\" and \"Ransomware-Incident\" are specific types of cyber attacks. So \"Cyber-Attack\" might be too general and should be rejected in favor of more specific labels. But the user's example includes \"Cyber-Attack\" as approved, so maybe it's acceptable. I need to check the principles again. The first principle says each label must represent a discrete event. \"Cyber-Attack\" is a discrete event, even if it's a broad category. So maybe it's okay. However, the consolidation principle says to merge clear synonyms or overly similar types. If \"Cyber-Attack\" is too broad, maybe it's better to have more specific labels. But the user's example includes it, so perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is a valid label, and the specific types are subcategories. But the user wants a list of 15\u00b11 labels. The original list has 13, so maybe it's okay. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, checking each label:\n\n1. Data-Breach: Event, okay.\n2. System-Outage: Event, okay.\n3. Malware-Outbreak: Event, okay.\n4. DDoS-Attack: Specific attack type, okay.\n5. Regulatory-Action: Event, okay.\n6. Major-Discovery: Event, okay.\n7. Software-Vulnerability: This is a state, not an event. Vulnerability is a flaw, not an incident. So this should be rejected.\n8. Cyber-Attack: Broad, but maybe acceptable as a general category. However, in the CISSM taxonomy, they have more specific subcategories. Maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is too vague. But the user's example includes it, so perhaps it's allowed. Alternatively, maybe it's better to split into more specific types. But since the user's example includes it, I'll tentatively approve it but note that it's a general term.\n9. Network-Intrusion: Event, okay.\n10. Security-Patch-Release: Event, okay.\n11. Cryptographic-Breakthrough: Event, okay.\n12. Ransomware-Incident: Specific attack type, okay.\n13. Cloud-Service-Disruption: Event, okay.\n\nSo from the original 13, \"Software-Vulnerability\" is rejected because it's a state, not an event. That leaves 12 labels. The target is 15\u00b11, so maybe we need to add more. Wait, the user's example has 3 approved and 3 rejected, but the original list here has 13. Wait, the user's example is just an example, not the actual case. The actual task is to process the given list. The user's candidate list has 13 labels. The target is 15\u00b11, so maybe we need to keep around 15. But after rejecting \"Software-Vulnerability\", we have 12. Maybe we need to check if any others can be merged or if some are redundant.\n\nLooking at \"Cyber-Attack\" and \"Network-Intrusion\": \"Network-Intrusion\" is a type of cyber attack. So maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is too broad and should be merged with others. But according to the principles, we should merge clear synonyms. If \"Cyber-Attack\" is a general term and others are specific, maybe it's better to keep the specific ones and remove the general. For example, \"Cyber-Attack\" could be merged into more specific types like DDoS, Ransomware, etc. But the user's example includes \"Cyber-Attack\" as approved, so perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe \"Cyber-Attack\" is a valid label as a general category, and the specific ones are subcategories. But the user wants a list of 15\u00b11, so maybe it's okay to have both. However, the consolidation principle says to merge clear synonyms. If \"Cyber-Attack\" is too broad, maybe it's better to split into more specific events. But the user's example includes it, so perhaps it's allowed. Let's tentatively approve it but note that it's a general term.\n\nAnother label to check: \"Regulatory-Action\". This is an event, like a new regulation being enacted. Okay.\n\n\"Major-Discovery\": This could be a discovery of a vulnerability or a new attack method. It's an event, so okay.\n\n\"Security-Patch-Release\": Event, okay.\n\n\"Cryptographic-Breakthrough\": Event, like a new encryption method or a break in existing encryption. Okay.\n\n\"Cloud-Service-Disruption\": Event, okay.\n\nSo after rejecting \"Software-Vulnerability\", we have 12 labels. The target is 15\u00b11, so maybe we need to add more. But the user's candidate list only has 13. Wait, the user's candidate list is the one provided, and we need to refine it. So perhaps the user expects us to reject some and maybe add others, but the task is to refine the given list. So maybe the answer is to reject \"Software-Vulnerability\" and keep the rest, but the target is 15\u00b11. Wait, the original list has 13 labels. After rejecting one, we have 12. The target is 15\u00b11, so maybe we need to add more. But the user hasn't provided additional labels, so perhaps the answer is to keep the 12 and note that more could be added. But the user's example has 3 approved and 3 rejected, but in this case, the original list is 13. Hmm, maybe the user expects us to process the given list and refine it to 15\u00b11 by merging or rejecting. Let's see.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to return a",
